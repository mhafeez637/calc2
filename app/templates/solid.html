<h3>SOLID Object Oriented Design</h3>

        <p> These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for
            maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to
            avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.
        </p>
        <p>SOLID stands for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>S</b> - Single-responsiblity Principle
            </li>
            <li><b>O</b> - Open-closed Principle
            </li>
            <li>

                <b>L</b> - Liskov Substitution Principle
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>I</b> - Interface Segregation Principle
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>D</b> - Dependency Inversion Principle
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Single-Responsibility Principle</h4>
        <p>Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:</p>

        <p> class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one
            job.</p>

        <p>In the Calculator example, We have to apply different operators like addition, subtraction, multiply
            and division.
        </p>
        <p> First, create the Addition classes and have the constructors set up the required parameters.
        </p>
        <img width=500 height=300 src="images/addition.jpg" alt="index"/>
        <p>Next, create the Calculations class and then write up the logic to sum up the numbers.</p>
        <img width=500 height=300 src="images/calculation.jpg" alt="index"/>

        <h4>Open-Closed Principle</h4>
        <p>Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:</p>

        <p> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
        </p>
        This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
        <p>
            Calculations class we can extend and add other object like multiply and division or history to
            extend it. We can without modifying exiting parent classes we can extend calculator and introduce
            new operator.
        </p>

        <img width=500 height=300 src="images/calculationext.jpg" alt="index"/>
        <h4>Liskov Substitution Principle</h4>
        <p>This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent
            class.</p>
        <p>
            We have coded every class separately and used the hierarchy method WHich helped us to extend the
            calculator without causing any negative impact on existing code
        </p>
        <img width=500 height=300 src="images/hierarchy.jpg" alt="index"/>
        <h4>Interface Segregation Principle</h4>
        <p>Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific Clients should not be forced to depend upon
            interfaces that they do not use. This principle deals with the disadvantages of implementing big
            interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>In Calculator single class we have implemented several interfaces. So we can provide a single
            implementation for all the common methods between the interfaces. The segregated interfaces will
            also force us to think of our code more from the clientâ€™s point of view, which will in turn lead to
            loose coupling and easy testing. So, not only have we made our code better to our clients, we also
            made it easier for ourselves to understand, test and implement.</p>
        <img width=500 height=300 src="images/calculator.jpg" alt="index"/>
        <h4>Dependency Inversion Principle</h4>
        <p>Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must
            not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.</p>
        <p>Calculation class is dependent on low level class. If we are looking to add another function to out
            calculator then we have to introduce another object or update existing object.</p>
