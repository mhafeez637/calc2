        <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div>
                <p> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design
                    around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field
                    that has unique attributes and behavior. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability,
                    scalability and efficiency. </p>
                <p> Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes
                    and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code </p>
                <p> Classes can also contain functions, called methods available only to objects of that type. These
                    functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of
                    object. </p>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315"
                                src="//youtube.com/embed/JeznW_7DlB0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p> The four pillars of object oriented programming are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Encapsulation</b>: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Inheritance</b>: child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class</li>
                    <li><b>Polymorphism</b>: many methods can do the same task</li>
                    <li><b>Abstraction</b>: only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
                <p>
                    Encapsulation means containing all important information inside an object, and only exposing
                    selected information to the outside world. Attributes and behaviors are defined by code inside the
                    class template.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, when an object is instantiated from the class, the data and methods are encapsulated in that
                    object. Encapsulation hides the internal software code implementation inside a class, and hides
                    internal data of inside objects.
                </p>
                <img width=740 height=621 src="images/encapsulation.jpg" alt="index"/>
                <p> In above example, We have defined (__init__) methods and variables private using double underscore.
                    we have standardized values to list of floats.</p>
                <p>Encapsulation in Python is, the data is hidden outside the object definition. It enables developers
                    to develop user-friendly experience. This is also helpful in securing data from breaches, as the
                    code is highly secured and cannot be accessed by outside sources.</p>
                <h4>Inheritance</h4>
                <p>
                    Inheritance allows classes to inherit features of other classes. Put another way, parent classes
                    extend attributes and behaviors to child classes. Inheritance supports reusability.
                </p>
                If basic attributes and behaviors are defined in a parent class, child classes can be created extending
                the functionality of the parent class, and adding additional attributes and behaviors.
                <p>
                    <img width=740 height=621 src="images/inheritance.jpg" alt="index"/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In above example we are inheriting calculator class from object Calculator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Single inheritance</b>: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called
                    single inheritance. We saw an example above.
                </p>
                <p><b>Multiple inheritance</b>: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called
                    multiple inheritance. In example below, calculation class is inheriting multiple classes
                </p>
                <img width=740 height=621 src="images/inheritance1.jpg" alt="index"/>
                <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                <p>
                    Polymorphism means designing objects to share behaviors. Using inheritance, objects can override
                    shared parent behaviors, with specific child behaviors. Polymorphism allows the same method to
                    execute different behaviors in two ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <Li>method overriding</Li>
                    <Li>method overloading</Li>
                </ul>
                <img width=740 height=621 src="images/polymorphism.jpg" alt="index"/>
                <p>
                    In above example, if no parameters are passed into the test_calculation_addition() method.
                    then default value will be passed. If a parameter is passed in test_calculation_addition(5),
                    then 5 is passed into the x parameter in test_calculation_addition(5), and 5 will be added to total.
                </p>
                <h4>Abstraction</h4>
                <p>Abstraction means that the user interacts with only selected attributes and methods of an object.
                    Abstraction uses simplified, high level tools, to access a complex object.
                </p>
                <p>Abstraction is using simple classes to represent complexity. Abstraction is an extension of
                    encapsulation. For example, we donâ€™t have to provide all the details to end user of how the
                    calculator works.</p>
                <p>Abstraction also serves an important security role. By only displaying selected pieces of data, and
                    only allowing data to be accessed through classes and modified through methods, we protect the data
                    from exposure.</p>
                <img width=500 height=300 src="images/abstraction.jpg" alt="index"/>
                <p>In above example, we have Abstraction history and calculator class</p>
                <img width=500 height=300 src="images/abstraction1.jpg" alt="index"/>
                <p>The benefits of abstraction are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <Li>Simple, high level user interfaces</Li>
                    <Li>Complex code is hidden</Li>
                    <Li>Security</Li>
                    <Li>Easier software maintenance</Li>
                    <Li>Code updates rarely change abstraction</Li>
                </ul>
                <p>Object Oriented programming requires thinking about the structure of the program and planning at the
                    beginning of coding. Looking at how to break up the requirements into simple, reusable classes that
                    can be used to blueprint instances of objects. Overall, implementing OOP allows for better data
                    structures and reusability, saving time in the long run.</p>
